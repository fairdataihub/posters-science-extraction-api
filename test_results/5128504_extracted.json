        "sectionContent": "We present an ongoing research effort to identify ionization sources in nearby AGN using Apache Point Observatory (APO) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We measure emission line ratios along the spatial extents of the narrow line region (NLR) using spectra from APO's Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) and HST's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectra reveal prominent emission lines of ionized gas that can be primarily attributed to star formation or AGN ionization. We construct BPT diagrams and compare with HST color images to isolate these regions and determine their connection to the kinematics of the outflowing gasses. When combined with our ongoing study of mass outflow rates, these efforts will help further our overall goal of determining the effectiveness of AGN feedback on their host galaxies."

HST spectra were obtained from MAST archive."

C. et al. 2017, ApJ, 834, 30) to determine the wavelength centroid, width and peak flux of the strong [O III] emission lines gathered by DIS.\n• We then use the resulting fit parameters as templates to obtain kinematics and flux ratios of all other lines and then separate components based on total flux.\n• Finally we generate the BPT Diagrams for each slit position and utilize the ratio points and distance data to create ionization maps to overlay onto scaled HST images for visible comparison."

(2006) to determine if the primary source of the ionizing radiation at each location in the narrow-line region (NLR) is due to the central AGN (Seyfert or LINER), star formation, or a mixture of both (composite).\n• We add a colorbar to each BPT diagram to indicate distance from the center of the observed slit.\n• Using the above data, we generate ionization maps to show the primary source of ionization of the brightest flux component along each position angle in the NLR and into the extended NLR (ENLR) within the host galaxy"
