Poetry is prominent in texts from these time periods and one of its characteristics is the use of metaphor. Distinguishing ﬁgurative and literal words or phrases is a major task for scholars in the Humanities, especially in the ﬁelds of literature, linguistics, and hermeneutics. We present a new, challenging dataset of early medieval Hebrew poetry with expert annotations of metaphors with baseline results."
