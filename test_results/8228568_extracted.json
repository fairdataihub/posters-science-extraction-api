Building on semi-structured interview data collected from fourteen researchers and practitioners engaging in digital humanities (DH) projects, this poster illustrates researchers’ various understandings of “digital humanist” as a term and highlights the complexity of “digital humanists” as a research community. This study provides insights into the collective imaginations of “digital humanist” as a research community."
