Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers have the potential to provide an increasingly improved alternative to cell lines as they differentiate into multiple intestinal cell types that are also present in vivo. However, these models currently lack immunocompetence, as they do not contain immune cells like for instance dendritic cells (DCs) that play an important role in intestinal immune responses.
Objective
To develop and characterize an immunocompetent hiPSC-derived IEC model, by co-culturing IEC layers with MUTZ-3 derived DCs.

Figure 2. A) Differentiation protocol of MUTZ-3-derived DCs B) Gene expression of markers for progenitors cells and mature DCs (mDCs) measured at D0, D7 and D9. Expression is relative to the progenitor cells which were set at 1. Expression of progenitor markers decreased whereas expression of mDCs increased in time.

Figure 3. A) hiPSCs and MUTZ-3 cells were differentiated into IECs and mDCs separately and co- cultured when fully differentiated. After 24h of co-culture the differentiation status of the IECs and DCs and the expression of cytokines was evaluated and compared to their respective monocultures before co-culture. B) Barrier integrity of the IEC layer. C) Gene expression of various markers for differentiation and cellular composition and cytokine expression in the IEC layer. D) Gene expression of maturation markers and cytokines in mDCs. In general, co-culturing has little effect on cellular composition, but increases cytokine expression.

Figure 4. Gene expression in iDCs after 48h exposure to micro/nano plastics at three different concentrations. A) Effects of the micro/nanoplastics on gene expression of markers for maturation of iDCs into mDCs and B) on cytokine expression. No significant effects were observed after 24h exposure to the micro/nanoplastics and no cytotoxicity was observed (data not shown). After 48h exposure to the PS394Eu plastics mild effects on cytokine expression were observed.
Conclusions
• hiPSC-derived IEC layers consist of multiple cell types that are present in the intestine in vivo
• hiPSC-derived IEC layers have the capacity to induce pro-inflammatory responses when exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus

• MUTZ-3-derived DCs express (immature/mature) DC markers when differentiated

• Co-culture of separately differentiated IECs and DCs was successful using an inverted IEC culture technique
• 24h co-culture of IECs and DCs did not appear to negatively affect the differentiation status of the cells and significantly increased cytokine expression in both cell models
• 24h and 48h exposure of iDCs to micro/nanoplastics did not result in strong immunomodulatory effects of any of the materials tested
