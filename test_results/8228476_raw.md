The corpus of late antique and medieval Hebrew is vast and represents a crucial linguistic and cultural bridge between Biblical and modern Hebrew. Poetry is prominent in texts from these time periods and one of its characteristics is the use of metaphor. Distinguishing ﬁgurative and literal words or phrases is a major task for scholars in the Humanities, especially in the ﬁelds of literature, linguistics, and hermeneutics. We present a new, challenging dataset of early medieval Hebrew poetry with expert annotations of metaphors with baseline results.
The Dataset
• Early medieval Hebrew poems. • 180 labeled texts, 7,000 sentences, 45,000 words. • 15% of the words are metaphors.

Inter Annotator Agreement
For ten generations, they did no good deeds
Inter-annotator agreement evaluates how consistently diﬀerent annotators label data for NLP research (measured in Cohen’s kappa). The score for our dataset is 0.618 (considered substantial).
