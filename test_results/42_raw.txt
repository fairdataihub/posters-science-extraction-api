Abstract: Carcinogenic Determination via Transformers (or CarD-T) is an automated pipeline that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic analysis to identify potential carcinogens from biomedical literature. The framework processes accumulating scientific publications (left), applies a trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract potential carcinogenic entities (center), and Probabilistic Carcinogen Denomination (or PCarD) to analyze temporal trends in evidence shifts (right). This approach enables classification of candidates through Bayesian temporal analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional manual literature review methods.
Introduction
Only 479 carcinogenic entities are officially recognized as carcinogens across regulatory databases (IARC, NTP, EPA, ECHA, & OSHA). Regulatory agencies rely on manual curation and are burdened by exponential growth of biomedical literature. CarD-T is an LLM framework to automate literature review of carcinogen curation with probabilistic analysis of likely carcinogenicity.
Methodology
CarD-T uses a Named Entity Recognition (NER) ELECTRA LLM and is trained on carcinogen-specific contexts from PubMed literature. Novelty of an NER approach over other LLM methods lies in the ability index identified carcinogens to source documents, circumventing hallucinations. Training data consisted of abstracts referencing IARC Group 1 and Group 2A carcinogens. Additionally, we implemented a novel AI- hybridized Context-Derived TF-IDF approach for noise reduction and synonym consolidation. This allowed us to convert implicating publications into evidence counts.
Figure 1. Probabilistic Carcinogen Denomination of Disputed Potential Carcinogens Over Time. • PCarD module applies Bayesian Negative Binomial Regression to analyze temporal evidence shifts, evaluating potential carcinogens based on changing evidence discourse with respect to time. B1 is Evidence Count, B2 is Evidence of a Dispute with time, B3 and B3’ are likelihood of Carcinogen or Non-Carcinogenicity.

Discussion/Conclusions
• Successfully integrated transformer learning with Bayesian modeling to assess temporal shifts in scientific consensus on carcinogens
• Documented fundamental 25-year research paradigm shift from chemical to biological and environmental carcinogenesis
• Current regulatory frameworks (except IARC) remain focused on chemical mechanisms despite emerging evidence for diverse carcinogenic pathways
• Temporal analysis provides critical context for evaluating contested entities where evidence conflicts or evolves over time
• Open-source design on consumer hardware democratizes carcinogen surveillance capabilities previously limited to specialized institutions
• Enables rapid response to emerging threats like COVID-19 by continuously monitoring scientific discourse in real-time
• Creates new opportunities for proactive public health monitoring without commercial or computational barriers
