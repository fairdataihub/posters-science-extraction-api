        "sectionContent": "Exploratory Interviews\nRongqian Ma, Indiana University Bloomington\nDH 2023, Graz, Austria, July 12-14\nThis ongoing study revisits the connotations of “digital humanists” and explores the reasons why a researcher does or does not self-identify as a digital humanist. Building on semi-structured interview data collected from fourteen researchers and practitioners engaging in digital humanities (DH) projects, this poster illustrates researchers’ various understandings of “digital humanist” as a term and highlights the complexity of “digital humanists” as a research community. This study provides insights into the collective imaginations of “digital humanist” as a research community."

I do research in digital humanities, so I guess technically I can say I am a digital humanist.” (P4)\nReason Participant (n=6)\nExample\nNot a “humanist” P12, P13 “I wouldn’t think I’m a humanist because my research question is not a humanities research question. I approach cultural heritage research from information science and design perspectives…. although I think what I’m doing is digital humanities work.” (P13)\nConcerned with technical skills (programming in particular)\nDH does not raise new research questions\nDigital methods are not necessary\nP8 “I just started learning programming and digital methods. Being a digital humanist will be my final goal, but I am not there yet.” (P8)\nP3 “…new constructs such as “DH” did not generate fundamentally new questions distinct from those in conventional or analog humanities.” (P3)\nP1, P5 “My research questions are not ultimately bound with digital methods; they can be addressed with digital methods, but not necessarily have to be.” (P5)"
