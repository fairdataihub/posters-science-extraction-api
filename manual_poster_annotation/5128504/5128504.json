      "description": "We present an ongoing research effort to identify ionization sources in nearby AGN using Apache Point Observatory (APO) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We measure emission line ratios along the spatial extents of the narrow line region (NLR) using spectra from APO's Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) and HST's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectra reveal prominent emission lines of ionized gas that can be primarily attributed to star formation or AGN ionization. We construct BPT diagrams and compare with HST color images to isolate these regions and determine their connection to the kinematics of the outflowing gasses. When combined with our ongoing study of mass outflow rates, these efforts will help further our overall goal of determining the effectiveness of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. We present two targets: NGC 1667, a Seyfert 2 galaxy with observed redshift of z = 0.01517 (319 pc/\"), and NGC 4051, a Seyfert 1 galaxy with z = 0.00234 (53 pc/\"). Overlaid APO BPT diagrams correspond well to visual regions of star formation and AGN ionization displayed in the HST images. Identification of ionization mechanisms are consistent for the [N II], [S II], and [O I] ratios, providing confidence in our methodology.",

      "description": "We employ a multiple component Gaussian fitting routine (Fischer, T. C. et al. 2017, ApJ, 834, 30) to determine the wavelength centroid, width and peak flux of the strong [O III] emission lines gathered by DIS. We then use the resulting fit parameters as templates to obtain kinematics and flux ratios of all other lines and then separate components based on total flux. We construct BPT (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich 1981) diagrams by determining ratios of the [O III] λ5007/Hβ λ4861 lines and comparing them with the ratios of [N II] λ6584, [S II] λ6716, λ6731, and [O I] λ6300 to H-alpha λ6563 for each kinematic component. We use the equations of Kewley et al. (2006) to determine if the primary source of the ionizing radiation at each location in the narrow-line region (NLR) is due to the central AGN (Seyfert or LINER), star formation, or a mixture of both (composite). Finally we generate the BPT Diagrams for each slit position and utilize the ratio points and distance data to create ionization maps to overlay onto scaled HST images for visible comparison. APO's DIS observations (four position angles for NGC 4051 and three for NGC 1667) were taken using B/R1200 gratings (resolving power R ~ 2000) with slit width = 2\".
