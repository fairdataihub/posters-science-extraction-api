        "sectionTitle": "Conclusion",
        "sectionContent": "• CURC loaded PLGA NPs were better candidates for controlled drug delivery due to hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the polymer.\n\n• No or slight cytotoxic effect of CURC NPs was observed on NHDFs with progressive cellular internalization of NPs.\n\n• The choice of polymer composition plays a key role in drug-polymer interactions and release kinetics to achieve more controlled delivery and improved therapeutic efficacy in regenerative medicine."
