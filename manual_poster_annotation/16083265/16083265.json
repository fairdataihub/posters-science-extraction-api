      "description": "This poster presents research on the influence of drug-polymer interactions on release kinetics of polymeric nanoparticles for drug delivery applications. Achieving nano-sized drug delivery systems has become crucial in addressing antimicrobial resistance and improving cancer treatments. The study focuses on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic acid)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA/PEG) nanoparticles synthesized using microfluidics and loaded with curcumin, a hydrophobic drug with anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. PLGA nanoparticles demonstrated superior encapsulation efficiency at approximately 66% compared to 14% for PLA/PEG nanoparticles, highlighting the difficulty of loading hydrophobic drugs into hydrophilic carriers. Release kinetics differed significantly between the two polymer systems, with PLGA nanoparticles showing controlled sustained release over 24 hours while PLA/PEG nanoparticles exhibited rapid burst release of 75% within the first hour. Cytotoxicity tests on A549 lung cancer cells yielded IC50 values of approximately 4.7-4.8 µg/mL for both formulations. These findings demonstrate the critical role of polymer composition in controlling drug-polymer interactions and release kinetics for biomedical applications in regenerative medicine.",

      "description": "PLGA and PLA/PEG nanoparticles were synthesized using a custom-built microfluidic device comprising a pumping module with two syringe pumps and a Passive Herringbone Mixer (PHBM) chip. For PLGA nanoparticles, Terumo 5 mL syringes were used with a total flow rate of 8 mL/min and a flow rate ratio of 4:1 (aqueous to organic phase). For PLA/PEG nanoparticles, the total flow rate was 3 mL/min with a 3:1 flow rate ratio. The final volume for both formulations was 2 mL. Nanoparticles were characterized for hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Drug loading was assessed through encapsulation efficiency and payload measurements. Release profiles were evaluated over 24 hours. Cytotoxicity was tested on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) at a cell density of 3x10^8 cells/mL after 24 hours of treatment. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.1 mg/mL after 72 hours. Cellular uptake was visualized using fluorescence microscopy at 2, 4, and 24-hour time points.",
