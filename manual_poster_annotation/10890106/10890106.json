      "description": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers have the potential to provide an increasingly improved alternative to cell lines as they differentiate into multiple intestinal cell types that are also present in vivo. However, these models currently lack immunocompetence, as they do not contain immune cells like for instance dendritic cells (DCs) that play an important role in intestinal immune responses. This poster presents the development and characterization of an immunocompetent hiPSC-derived IEC model by co-culturing IEC layers with MUTZ-3 derived DCs. The poster demonstrates that hiPSC-derived IEC layers consist of multiple cell types present in the intestine in vivo and have the capacity to induce pro-inflammatory responses when exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. MUTZ-3-derived DCs express immature and mature DC markers when differentiated. Co-culture of separately differentiated IECs and DCs was successful using an inverted IEC culture technique. 24h co-culture of IECs and DCs did not negatively affect the differentiation status of the cells and significantly increased cytokine expression in both cell models. As a case study, the model was tested with microplastics exposure, showing that 24h and 48h exposure of immature DCs to micro/nanoplastics did not result in strong immunomodulatory effects of any of the materials tested (HDPE269, PET_c000, PS394Eu).",

After 24h of co-culture, the differentiation status of the IECs and DCs and the expression of cytokines was evaluated and compared to their respective monocultures before co-culture. For the microplastics exposure study, immature DCs were exposed to three different micro/nanoplastics (HDPE269, PET_c000, PS394Eu) at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml for 24h and 48h.
