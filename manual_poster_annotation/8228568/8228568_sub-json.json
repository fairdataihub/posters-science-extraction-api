Building on semi-structured interview data collected from fourteen researchers and practitioners engaging in digital humanities (DH) projects, this poster illustrates researchers' various understandings of \"digital humanist\" as a term and highlights the complexity of \"digital humanists\" as a research community. This study provides insights into the collective imaginations of \"digital humanist\" as a research community."
