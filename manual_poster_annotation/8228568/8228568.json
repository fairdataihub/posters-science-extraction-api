      "description": "This ongoing study revisits the connotations of 'digital humanists' and explores the reasons why a researcher does or does not self-identify as a digital humanist. Building on semi-structured interview data collected from fourteen researchers and practitioners engaging in digital humanities (DH) projects, this poster illustrates researchers' various understandings of 'digital humanist' as a term and highlights the complexity of 'digital humanists' as a research community. The study provides insights into the collective imaginations of 'digital humanist' as a research community. The research employs qualitative semi-structured interviews to address two main questions: how researchers currently understand the connotations of 'digital humanists' as a research identity, and why researchers do or do not self-identify as a digital humanist. Findings indicate that researchers' self-confidence in technical literacy and the nature of research questions affect their self-identification as a digital humanist.",

Participants included Master's students (n=2), PhD candidates (n=5), postdoc (n=1), assistant professors (n=4), associate professors (n=1), and curator (n=1). The inclusive screening criterion was any researcher or practitioner who has been actively engaging in DH projects. Two primary interview questions were asked: (1) Do you self-identify as a digital humanist, depending on your personal understanding of the term? (2) Why or why not? Responses were analyzed to identify patterns in self-identification rationales.",

I do research in digital humanities, so I guess technically I can say I am a digital humanist.\" (P4)\n\nTable 2. Why do researchers NOT self-identify as digital humanists?\n\nNot a \"humanist\" - P12, P13: \"I wouldn't think I'm a humanist because my research question is not a humanities research question. I approach cultural heritage research from information science and design perspectives…. although I think what I'm doing is digital humanities work.\" (P13)\n\nConcerned with technical skills (programming in particular) - P8: \"I just started learning programming and digital methods. Being a digital humanist will be my final goal, but I am not there yet.\" (P8)\n\nDH does not raise new research questions - P3: \"…new constructs such as \"DH\" did not generate fundamentally new questions distinct from those in conventional or analog humanities.\" (P3)\n\nDigital methods are not necessary - P1, P5: \"My research questions are not ultimately bound with digital methods; they can be addressed with digital methods, but not necessarily have to be.\" (P5)"
