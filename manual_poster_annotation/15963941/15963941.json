      "description": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has one of the longest RNA genomes among RNA viruses. To correct replication errors, it uses a unique proofreading mechanism involving the nsp14 protein, which has 3'-5' exonuclease activity, assisted by the cofactor nsp10. Currently, there are no drugs targeting this function. To support antiviral research, nsp14 and nsp10 were expressed and purified in E. Coli cells, and a FRET-based biochemical assay was developed to study their exonuclease activity, as previously mentioned in the literature. This system lays the groundwork for identifying future inhibitors of the nsp14-nsp10 complex. Optimization of the biochemical assay of the enzyme nsp14-10 allowed the development of a sensitive, reproducible, and effective method to study the activity of this enzyme complex. A compound known in the literature as an inhibitor of the nsp14-10 complex (Dynasore NO-Cat, IC50 = 3.3 μM ± 0.4) was used to validate the assay. This result represents an important step in furthering the biochemical characterization of nsp14-10 and facilitating future screening activities for potential inhibitors, with possible implications in the development of new antiviral strategies.",
