## Introduction

The corpus of late antique and medieval Hebrew is vast and represents a crucial linguistic and cultural bridge between Biblical and modern Hebrew. Poetry is prominent in texts from these time periods and one of its characteristics is the use of metaphor. Distinguishing figurative and literal words or phrases is a major task for scholars in the Humanities, especially in the fields of literature, linguistics, and hermeneutics. We present a new, challenging dataset of early medieval Hebrew poetry with expert annotations of metaphors with baseline results.

## The Dataset

• Early medieval Hebrew poems.
• 180 labeled texts, 7,000 sentences, 45,000 words.
• 15% of the words are metaphors.

| Hebrew | English | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| טבענו בגזרות, כשטופי ים | We drowned in decrees, like sea washed | There are too many decrees |
| הצית נשמה ויבער נר | Ignite a soul, fire a candle | Create a soul |
| עד דור עשירי לא עשו פרי | Until the tenth generation they did not bear fruit | For ten generations, they did no good deeds |

### Inter Annotator Agreement

Inter-annotator agreement evaluates how consistently different annotators label data for NLP research (measured in Cohen's kappa). The score for our dataset is 0.618 (considered substantial).

### Language models (pre-trained & adapted)

Trained on additional prose and poetic medieval texts (Project Ben-Yehuda*) + Piyyut dataset

| Model | Data Size (words) | Data Type |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| BEREL | 220 Million | Medieval |
| AlephBERT | 2 Billion | Modern |
| AlephBERT Adapted | 2 Billion + 10 Million | Modern + Medieval |

*Project Ben-Yehuda is a volunteer-based online library of free Hebrew literature.

## Results

• AlephBERT is outperformed by AlephBERT Adapted.
• **BEREL**, pre-trained on medieval texts, shows the best results.

## Error Analysis

ילד לניחוח חשקתיו

(A child for a scent - I have desired)

ילד לניחוח חשקתיו

Berel

Expert explanation: The child is a non-metaphorical epithet for Isaac. "Scent" is a metonymic term for "sacrifice".
