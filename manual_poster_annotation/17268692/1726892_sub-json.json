        "sectionTitle": "Background",
        "sectionContent": "• Research software is a critical element of modern scientific research.\n\n• Making it FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is crucial to support reproducibility, transparency, sustainability, and scientific progress.\n\n• The FAIR4RS principles (2022) provide a framework to achieve this through unique identifiers, metadata, license, and more. They are now being adopted by researchers, organizations, and funders worldwide."
      },
      {
        "sectionTitle": "Problem",
        "sectionContent": "• By design, the FAIR4RS principles do not provide concrete implementation steps, making them difficult for developers to apply.\n\n• Field-specific guidelines, such as FAIR-BioRS (2023), exist but lack broad, cross-disciplinary input.\n\n• The 2 year community survey of the FAIR4RS principles confirmed the need for generalized actionable guidelines."
      },
      {
        "sectionTitle": "Solution",
        "sectionContent": "• To address that, we established the Actionable Guidelines for the FAIR Research Software (Actionable FAIR4RS) Task Force in December 2024 under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA).\n\n• The Task Force is run by a diverse international team of researchers and research software developers from various fields (Fig. 1).\n\n• Goal: Create actionable and domain-agnostic guidelines for implementing the FAIR4RS principles, through a comprehensive, community-driven methodology."
      },
      {
        "sectionTitle": "Progress",
        "sectionContent": "• We began by conducting an in-depth analysis of the FAIR4RS principles and identified six key categories where actionable instructions are needed, each with a series of outstanding questions (Fig. 2).\n\n• Six subgroups are now conducting literature reviews and community outreach to answer these questions.\n\n• Fig. 3 illustrates the approach and preliminary findings from the subgroup working on category C5, including a preliminary list of metadata elements we believe are essential for software reuse and ways to include that metadata with software."
      },
      {
        "sectionTitle": "Next Steps",
        "sectionContent": "• Dec 2025: Subgroups complete investigations to establish answers for outstanding questions.\n\n• Mar 2026: Release draft guidelines for broad community feedback.\n\n• Summer 2026: Publish the first official version of the Actionable FAIR4RS Guidelines.\n\n• Fall 2026: Transition to a maintained, living resource that evolves with community input."
