      "description": "Carcinogenic Determination via Transformers (CarD-T) is an automated pipeline that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic analysis to identify potential carcinogens from biomedical literature. Only 479 carcinogenic entities are officially recognized as carcinogens across regulatory databases (IARC, NTP, EPA, ECHA, and OSHA). Regulatory agencies rely on manual curation and are burdened by exponential growth of biomedical literature. CarD-T addresses these limitations by using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) ELECTRA LLM trained on carcinogen-specific contexts from PubMed literature to automate literature review of carcinogen curation with probabilistic analysis of likely carcinogenicity. The framework processes accumulating scientific publications, applies a trained NER model to extract potential carcinogenic entities, and uses Probabilistic Carcinogen Denomination (PCarD) to analyze temporal trends in evidence shifts. This approach enables classification of candidates through Bayesian temporal analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional manual literature review methods.",

Training data consisted of abstracts referencing IARC Group 1 and Group 2A carcinogens. Additionally, we implemented a novel AI-hybridized Context-Derived TF-IDF approach for noise reduction and synonym consolidation. This allowed us to convert implicating publications into evidence counts.\n\nWorkflow Components:\n1. Biomedical Literature → Time series accumulation\n2. CarD-T framework identifies new potential carcinogenic Entity (or E₁)\n3. Carcinogen literature accumulating → Likelihood E₁ is a carcinogen\n4. Time series analysis → μ₁, μ₂, μ₃, μ₄ distributions"
