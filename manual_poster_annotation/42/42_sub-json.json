        "sectionContent": "Carcinogenic Determination via Transformers (or CarD-T) is an automated pipeline that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic analysis to identify potential carcinogens from biomedical literature. The framework processes accumulating scientific publications (left), applies a trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract potential carcinogenic entities (center), and Probabilistic Carcinogen Denomination (or PCarD) to analyze temporal trends in evidence shifts (right). This approach enables classification of candidates through Bayesian temporal analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional manual literature review methods."

        "sectionTitle": "Introduction",
        "sectionContent": "Only 479 carcinogenic entities are officially recognized as carcinogens across regulatory databases (IARC, NTP, EPA, ECHA, & OSHA). Regulatory agencies rely on manual curation and are burdened by exponential growth of biomedical literature. CarD-T is an LLM framework to automate literature review of carcinogen curation with probabilistic analysis of likely carcinogenicity."
      },
      {
        "sectionTitle": "Methodology",
        "sectionContent": "CarD-T uses a Named Entity Recognition (NER) ELECTRA LLM and is trained on carcinogen-specific contexts from PubMed literature. Novelty of an NER approach over other LLM methods lies in the ability index identified carcinogens to source documents, circumventing hallucinations. Training data consisted of abstracts referencing IARC Group 1 and Group 2A carcinogens. Additionally, we implemented a novel AI-hybridized Context-Derived TF-IDF approach for noise reduction and synonym consolidation. This allowed us to convert implicating publications into evidence counts."
